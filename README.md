# `THE FLASH`

 We tend to think that memory, attention or concentration are skills that we have, in which some people have more facility in them than others. However, these skills can be exercised. Are you ready for the challenge?



 ## UX

 This project is about a memory game. The purpose of this website is to test the user's mental speed to remember cards.


 **User Stories:** 

 - Be captivated with the design 
 

 - Play the game and try to pass it until the time it's over.

 - Be aware of the merits and mistakes.

 


 **Business Goals:** 

 - Attract users who want to play the game.

 
 **Wireframes**

 I decided to use the Balsamic tool for creating the mockups because it gave us the first impression of our project and a  clear idea of what we want to work.

### Automated Testing
- I did manual checks during development and before committing.

 ### Validator 

 This project was validate through [ W3 CSS validator](https://validator.w3.org/) ,  [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

 - They were solved by adding to the top of the script file the following comment "/ * jshint esversion: 6 * /" to tell jshint the use of ES6.

 ### Bugs
 The following errors occurred in the project:
 - By the time the game is won or lost, a modal box is created that would appear according to the established criteria.
 The problem only arose on mobile phones with an IOS system and only in a certain situation. When you click on the cards, if you got the match, they were flipp over so you could see which cards were missing. The problem arises when time runs out and the modal box appears, either winning or losing, the cards protrude out above it, generating an erroneous and overlapping vision.

  - The proposed solution was to remove the modal box, and create two html files (game over and youwin) and redirect the page with a "documen.location.href = ''" when the criteria by the game are met (win or lose) . This allows the game displayed correctly on all devices and operating systems.

 ## Deployment

 This project was created on GitHub and used the GitPod development environment to write the code. 
 To deploy it we have to follow the following steps:
 - Open the 'Settings' section of the project repository on GitHub.
 - From there, click on the 'GitHub Pages' section.
 - Selected 'master branch' as ​​a source.
 This implemented the project on the GitHub pages and will make it possible to share the website live with other people.
