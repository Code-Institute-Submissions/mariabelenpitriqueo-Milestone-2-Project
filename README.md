# `THE FLASH`

 We tend to think that memory, attention or concentration are skills that we have, in which some people have more facility in them than others. However, these skills can be exercised. Are you ready for the challenge?



 ## UX

 This project is about a memory game. The purpose of this website is to test the user's mental speed to remember cards.


 **User Stories:**

 - Play the game and try to pass it until the time it's over.
